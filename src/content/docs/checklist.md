title: "New app checklist"
description: "Everything a new app needs before its first release, grouped by area."
---

Each group links to the page with the rules and the Editora code to copy. Everything here is a MUST unless it says
SHOULD.

## Platform

[Platform baseline](../platform/)

- [ ] JDK 25 or newer (`release` 25 is the floor) and JavaFX 27 or newer
- [ ] One JPMS module, `com.<app>`
- [ ] Maven Wrapper committed (`mvnw`, `mvnw.cmd`, `.mvn/wrapper/`)
- [ ] AtlantaFX light and dark themes, following the system by default
- [ ] Inter bundled and attached to every scene and dialog (SHOULD)

## Code quality

[Code quality gates](../quality/)

- [ ] Every package `@NullMarked`; NullAway on Error Prone fails the build
- [ ] Spotless with Palantir Java Format
- [ ] JUnit 5 and headless FX tests (`-Dglass.platform=Headless`), FX tests tagged `fx`
- [ ] JaCoCo check at 0.90 lines and 0.90 methods

## Keyboard and commands

[Keyboard first](../keyboard/)

- [ ] One `CommandRegistry`: every action is a command with an id
- [ ] Command Palette as an in-scene overlay, not a `Popup`
- [ ] Emacs and CUA keymaps at least, with user overrides on top

## Settings

[Settings](../settings/)

- [ ] Settings window with a page sidebar, search and live apply
- [ ] A palette command for every setting
- [ ] Versioned config in `~/.<app>`, with migrations and downgrade backups
- [ ] Export and import of the config folder
- [ ] Settings sync through a Git/GitHub repository (SHOULD)

## Diagnostics

[Diagnostics and support](../diagnostics/)

- [ ] Status-bar echo and Message Log
- [ ] Debug Log with a session file, and an uncaught exception handler
- [ ] Daily update check with an off switch; About shows versions and update status
- [ ] Report a Problem (redacted, prefilled GitHub issue) and `--report`

## Command line and languages

[Command line](../command-line/) · [Internationalization](../i18n/)

- [ ] `--help`, `--version`, `--config-dir`, `--dev`
- [ ] Single instance per config folder
- [ ] At least six message catalogs, with a parity test

## Repository

[Repository documents](../repository/)

- [ ] `README.md` with the badge row and a light/dark hero screenshot
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` in Keep a Changelog format
- [ ] MIT `LICENSE`, and `NOTICE` with every third-party licence
- [ ] `AGENTS.md`, with a one-line `CLAUDE.md` pointing to it
- [ ] `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `docs/` and `branding/`
- [ ] `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml`

## Packaging and signing

[Packaging, signing and release](../release/)

- [ ] jpackage installers through JReleaser: Linux x64 and arm64, macOS arm64 and x64, Windows x64
- [ ] macOS `.dmg` signed with Developer ID, notarized and stapled
- [ ] Linux downloads with `.asc` signatures from the shared release key
- [ ] Build provenance attestations for every download
- [ ] Windows `.msi` Authenticode, once the certificate is chosen (SHOULD)
- [ ] Homebrew cask in `adriandeleon/homebrew-tap` and a winget package `AdrianDeLeon.<App>` (SHOULD)

## CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

[CI/CD](../release/#cicd-github-actions)

- [ ] `ci.yml` on every push and pull request: Format and Build & Test, both required checks for `master`
- [ ] `full-tests.yml` on Linux, macOS and Windows: daily, on a `full-ci` label, before every release (SHOULD)
- [ ] `release.yml` on a `v*` tag that matches the pom, with a `workflow_dispatch` dry run
- [ ] Every third-party action pinned to a commit SHA
- [ ] Dependabot for `github-actions` and `maven`
- [ ] `permissions: contents: read` by default; write only in publishing jobs
- [ ] `timeout-minutes` on every job; superseded pull-request runs cancelled
- [ ] Test and coverage reports uploaded; coverage totals in the job summary
- [ ] Signing skipped without secrets, but a tag without them fails
- [ ] A smoke launch of the packaged app on each OS before release
